Localization Algorithms

1. Extented kalman filter - gaussian filter which helps in estimating state of non linear models

2. Markov Localization - Baye's filter localization algorithm, maintains a probability distribution over the set of
                        all possble positions and orientations where the robot might be located at.

3. Grid localization - histogram filter, since it is capable of estimating robots positions using grids

4. Monte Carlo Localization - particle filter, it estimates robot location using particles
