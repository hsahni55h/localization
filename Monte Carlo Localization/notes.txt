Bayes Filtering
-----------------------------------------


The powerful Monte Carlo localization algorithm estimates the posterior distribution of a robot’s position and orientation based on sensory information. 
This process is known as a recursive Bayes filter.

Using a Bayes filtering approach, roboticists can estimate the state of a dynamical system from sensor measurements.

In mobile robot localization, it’s important to be acquainted with the following definitions:

Dynamical system: The mobile robot and its environment
State: The robot’s pose, including its position and orientation.
Measurements: Perception data(e.g. laser scanners) and odometry data(e.g. rotary encoders)

The goal of Bayes filtering is to estimate a probability density over the state space conditioned on the measurements. 
The probability density, or also known as posterior is called the belief and is denoted as:

Bel(X_t)=P(X_t ∣Z_1...t)

Xt: State at time t
Z1…t : Measurements from time 1 up to time t

Given a set of probabilities, P(A|B) is calculated as follows:

P(A∣B)=  P(B∣A)∗P(A) / P(B) = P(B∣A)∗P(A) / P(A)∗P(B∣A)+P(¬A)∗P(B∣¬A)
